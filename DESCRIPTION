Description: Provides functions and command-line user interface to generate 
  allocation sequence by response-adaptive randomization for clinical trials. 
  The package currently supports two response-adaptive randomization procedures, 
  Doubly Adaptive Biased Coin Design ('DBCD') and Sequential Estimation-adjusted 
  Urn Model ('SEU'), for two endpoints, binary and normal. One-sided proportion 
  (or mean) difference and Chi-square (or 'ANOVA') hypothesis testing methods 
  are also available in the package to facilitate the inference for 
  treatment effect under different sample sizes and the inference for sample size 
  under different treatment effects. Additionally, the package provides 
  comprehensive and efficient tools to allow one to evaluate and compare the 
  performance of randomization procedures and tests based on various criteria. 
  Five allocation functions for 'DBCD' and six addition rule functions for 'SEU' are 
  implemented to target allocations such as 'Neyman', 'Rosenberger' and 'Urn' 
  allocations.
